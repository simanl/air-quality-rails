# This script is used in the development environment with Docker to check if the
# app database exists, and runs the database setup if it doesn't, as it is the
# case when the project runs for the first time on the development machine.
#
# We are using this custom script instead of running the
# `rake db:version  || rake db:setup` commands, as that currently leaves a
# couple of small ruby zombie processes running in the app container:
require 'rubygems'
require 'rake'
require 'bundler'
