#! /bin/bash

# Starts a debug session on the server. It's used whenever the `rails server`
# process was detached from the terminal (as is the case with daemonization,
# pow server and docker-compose environments, AFAIK) and it's inaccessible via
# Terminal/Console.

# The byebug debug server has to be running alongside with rails for this to work.
# In this project, that's achieved only when running in development environment,
# starting the process with the environment variable `ENABLE_DEBUG_SERVER=true`.
